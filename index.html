          <h2>INDIAN MONK AND PHILOSOPHER</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Swami Vivekananda</b> was one of the most popular Hindu monks and spiritual leaders of India.
            His name was Narendranath Datta. He was born on 12 January 1863 into a Bengali Kayastha family of Calcutta.
            His father’s name was Vishwanath Datta. He was a legal practitioner at the Calcutta High Court.
            His mother’s name was Bhubaneswari Devi. She was a housewife.
            He was inclined towards spirituality from a very young age. He used to meditate in front of the idols of Lord Shiva, Lord Ram, etc.
            Swami Vivekananda’s speech at Parliament of the World’s Religions in Chicago in 1893 made him profoundly famous. He began his speech with “Sisters and brothers of America…” which won many hearts.
            He was an ardent disciple of spiritual leader, Sri Ramakrishna. He revived Hinduism in India.
            He made a prominent contribution to spreading the concept of Indian nationalism among the people of India.
            Swami Vivekananda’s birthday 12th January is celebrated as National Youth Day in India.
            He died on 4 July 1902 while meditating. His disciples believed that he attained Mahasamadhi.
